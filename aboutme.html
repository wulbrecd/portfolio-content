			<p>My name is David Wulbrecht.  I am 31 years old and served in the Marine Corps for 5 years.  During my time in the Marine Corps, I worked as a communications technician
				working to troubleshoot and, if possible or allowable, repair equipment such as radios, computers, phones, and ground satellites.  While primarily being stationed in Camp
				Lejeune, NC, I spent 6 months in Romania/Latvia and 6 months in Okinawa/Mainland Japan.  Below include pictures from my time in the Marine Corps.

			<p>After getting out of the Marine Corps, I proceeded to go to Oakland University for a degree in IT.  While at Oakland University, I was the Vice President, Treasurer,
				and Secretary of the Student Veterans of Oakland University as well as a work-study in the Veterans Support Services office, assisting students with GI Bill Benefits with a
				focus on Veterans Mental Health in the SVA Chapter (SVOU).  After graduating Oakland Univeristy in May, 2021, I was accepted into grad school at the University of Michigan for a
				Masters in UX/UI Design and Research.  I also currently serve as Vice President for the SVAUM.
