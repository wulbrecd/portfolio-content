		<p>One major organization for Veterans is the VFW (the Veterans of Foreign Wars).  While primarily an organization for those Veterans who have been in some sort of war 
			or conflict, they are a solid community of Veterans.  Lately, they have relaxed the requirements to join from having been in war or conflict to having served during 
			a time of war in conflict in general in an attempt to recruit a younger audience to keep the organization going.
		</p>

		<p>There are many VFW posts across the country.  While you may not be a member, they allow all Veterans and Dependants to visit their posts.</p>
