			<h2>SVA</h2>
			<p>The Student Veterans of America Organization (SVA), is a nationally known Organization comprised of many Student Veteran run chapters across the country.  Founded in 2008, the organization has expanded to 
				chapters many chapters around the country.  This new organization helped push the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill into law.  
				These chapters are dedicated to community service, Veteran mental health and well-being, community, and advocation of policy to improve the quality of life for 
				Veterans on campus.  Every year, in early January, there is a National Conference (NatCon) held in either Texas, California (LA), or Florida (Disney).  At this conference,
				many chapters around the country gather to sit in lectures or panels on things like leadership, running a student organization, the job hiring process, and advocacy for Veterans.
				There are also guest speakers and awards for Veteran of the Year, Chapter of the Year, etc.
